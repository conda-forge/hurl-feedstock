  summary: Run and Test HTTP Requests with plain text and curl
  description: |
    Hurl is a command line tool that runs HTTP requests defined in a simple plain text format.

    It can chain requests, capture values and evaluate queries on headers and body response. Hurl is very 
    versatile: it can be used for both fetching data and testing HTTP sessions.

    Hurl makes it easy to work with HTML content, REST / SOAP / GraphQL APIs, or any other XML / JSON based APIs.
